# Factor-Analysis-Report-for-NHANES-2013-2014-Age-Prediction-Subset
This mini project includes Factor Analysis for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014 Age Prediction Subset. In this project, I conducted Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). These analyses helped uncover patterns in the data. The goal was to predict age based on health and nutrition variables. This project provided valuable insights into the relationships between different health measurements and age. I look forward to applying these findings in future research.
